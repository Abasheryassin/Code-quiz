# Coding Quiz

## Description

For this project, I wanted to create a clean interactive webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to test my coding knowledge. During this project, I learned how JS navigates through the DOM of the webpage allowing coders to access exactly what they need. The quiz content helped me solidify my coding knowledge by putting it into a numerical score.

## Installation
